ML-web-based system that can find similar products based on user inputs

That's actually a part of an interview process, I was given 7 hours to do exactly the following:
```
- Build an ML-web-based system that can find similar products based on user inputs, then deploy it. So, we have only one textbox for product input and another one “ie.. label” for model outputs.

You can focus on Arabic-written products only.

Plz, be cautious of similar items such as “هاتف” and “غطاء هاتف”, so each of them shouldn’t appear in the other one’s search.

You can use the attached JSON file “Black Friday” for validation.
```
I have now 5.5 hours left -spent the first 90 minutes planning the work :) - so let's go
